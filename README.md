Processing
==========

A couple simple Processing sketches I've made for fun

Doodler - A small drawing app that released on Sourceforge a while back. Executable files for several versions are included (for both Windows and Linux)

Sierpinski - A Processing Sketch inspired by the Splash MIT 2013 class "Programming a la Fractal Forgeries." Uses a very simple algorithm to draw sierpinski's triangle over many iterations. You can replace the values of the corners array to get other odd variants of the triangle (some don't produce anything meaningful).
